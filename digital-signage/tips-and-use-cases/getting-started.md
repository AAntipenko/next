### What is friendlyway Cloud Platform? <a href="#bookmark1" id="bookmark1"></a>

friendlyway Cloud Platform (the Platform) is a cloud-based software platform built on a microservice-oriented architecture that integrates both hardware and software components for digital signage, interactive presentations, and digitized point-of-service processes.

Content creation, as well as scheduling and monitoring playback on end devices, does not require installing additional software. To access the Platform, you only need a browser and an Internet/Intranet connection. friendlyway Player that reproduces the assigned content is installed on end devices. Synchronization with the cloud occurs automatically within a few seconds.

After entering all the data, confirm the creation of the device by clicking Save.

See Chapter 5 to learn how a PC running friendlyway Player connects to the Platform.

#### Content creation <a href="#bookmark6" id="bookmark6"></a>

We developed our system to ensure you have a simple and easy way to create and publish various types of content. The main elements of our system, designed for content management, are the Content, Schedule, and Media modules. These control elements will be sufficient for you to create and publish your content according to a set schedule.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/10 (1).jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To create new content for your output device, go to the Content area. Here, you can find tools for creating various presentation options for content on different types of devices (kiosks, monitors, digital boards, etc.). The main elements are:

* ScreenFlow — enables complex interactive projects with different media objects and screen layouts. It supports a variety of content types, including images, videos, and text, and offers customizable display options.
* Playlist — allows you to set up simpler slideshows with images and videos on the screen, controlling the sequence and display time of elements and various transition options between them for a more dynamic presentation.
* ShowBoard — splits the screen into several fixed areas, allowing for the creation of engaging content across multiple displays, integrating various control elements for increased interactivity: video chat, links to external web pages, interactive wayfinding maps, etc.

**Creating a ScreenFlow**

To create a new ScreenFlow, go to the ScreenFlow tab in the Content menu and click Create.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/11.jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Fill in the necessary information, including:

Name: Provide a name for the ScreenFlow.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/12.jpeg" alt="" width="425"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Description: Add a ScreenFlow description for easier content identification (optional).

Resolution: Resolution and orientation of the screen on which the ScreenFlow will be played. Select from the provided drop-down list of most common resolutions or enter custom values.

To add a media object to your presentation, drag the necessary object to the workspace:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/4 (2).jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After inserting an object into the workspace, its properties are displayed on the right side of the editor. Here is an example of properties for the Text object:

General: Object placement settings (W - width; H - height; X-Y: coordinates of the upper left corner of the object).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/5 (2).jpeg" alt="" width="333"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Text: Font type and size, text position and color, and line spacing.

Text Value: Displayed text and its formatting (bold, italic, underlined).

Actions: An action when touching an object (none, go to a specific screen, move by the display, change the color theme, open an application).

In the same way, you can insert and set other objects on the first screen.

To add another screen to the presentation, click the + sign in the navigation area:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/6 (3).jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To insert an image into the ScreenFlow, the desired image must first be uploaded to the gallery. This can be done through the Media area of the Platform or directly in the ScreenFlow using the “Choose image from gallery” button:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/7 (3).jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After inserting an image into the second screen, the ScreenFlow structure will look like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/8 (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When the screen is maximized, the inserted media objects are displayed. When you click on three dots of the screen and the object, a context menu opens:

* Rename: Rename a screen or a media object.
* Copy element ID: Copy only the ID of a screen or a media object.
* Copy: Copy a screen or a media object itself.
* Delete: Delete a screen or a media object.

You can quickly change the ScreenFlow structure and make it more understandable:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/9 (3).jpeg" alt="" width="394"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you click on a screen in the presentation structure, the screen properties are displayed on the right side. In the Actions area, you can define the transition between screens. Click Add Action and expand its settings:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/10 (3).jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the Screen drop-down list, select the name of the screen you want to display after a certain trigger (e.g., timeout) and specify the duration of the Delay. The animation (fading or sliding in different directions) is set in the Transition Effects field.

This action parameter should be set separately for each slide if there are no other triggers for changing screens in the presentation.

You can check how the project will look on the target display at any time by clicking the Preview button ![A white arrow on a black background

Description automatically generated](<../../.gitbook/assets/11 (1).png>) .

To exit the presentation, click the Back to ScreenFlows button in the upper left corner. The presentation is automatically saved to the cloud.

Once the ScreenFlow has been created, and you have previewed and approved it, it must be published for displaying on end devices. To do this, click the three-dot menu of the needed ScreenFlow and select the Publish option:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/12 (2).jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Building a Playlist**

To create a new Playlist, click Create in the Playlists tab of the Content menu:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/14 (1).png" alt="" width="348"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Description: Add a Playlist description for easier content identification (optional).

Playback Mode: Choose whether the items in the Playlist should be played sequentially in the defined (Normal) or random (Shuffle) order.

Transition Effect: Choose a transition effect to be applied as the default for the entire Playlist. Options include Fade, Slide Right, Slide Left, Slide Up, and Slide Down.

Transition Time: Set the duration in seconds of any transition effect selected above.

Display Type: Select how the Playlist items should be displayed on the screen: Stretch, Center, or Adjust.

Image Display Time: Set the default duration in seconds for newly added images in the Playlist. The display duration of videos and PowerPoint presentations is automatically taken from the object properties.

Background Color: Specify the background color for the Playlist area not occupied by the content of the Playlist items.

Audio: Configure the audio settings for the Playlist. Choose one or multiple MP3 files from the gallery that will be played sequentially

and cyclically as background sound or enter the URL of a Stream. Set the required volume and enable the “Fade audio in/out” option to smoothly fade the sound during playback.

Once you click Save, the system creates an empty Playlist with the defined settings. The next step is to populate it with items, such as images, videos, PowerPoint presentations, ScreenFlows, or other Playlists. To add media objects, click Add Item, select the desired items from the gallery, and confirm your choice by clicking the Insert button:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/15 (2).jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The inserted media objects are displayed as a list:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/16 (2).jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can now manually edit standard settings for each object. The total display time of the Playlist is the sum of the display time of each item and transition effects.

To add another item to the Playlist, click Add Item. To remove an item from the playlist, click on the three-dot menu of that item on the list and select the Delete option:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/17 (3).jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can change the order of items in the playlist at any time. To do this, drag the item in the list to the desired position while holding the mouse pointer on the line with the previous item:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/18.jpeg" alt="" width="555"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After entering all the data and media objects, you can preview the Playlist. Select a Device for the content to be previewed on from the drop-down list at the bottom right corner and click Preview.

All items in the Playlist are displayed in the specified order in the cycle. If the Shuffle option is activated in the Playlist settings, the media objects are displayed in random order.

Please note: MS PowerPoint must be installed on each output device to display PowerPoint presentations!

Once you have created, previewed, and approved the Playlist, you can publish it. To do this, click on the Publish icon in the Playlist editor or, if you are on the list of all Playlists, use the three-dot menu and select the Publish option:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/19 (1).jpeg" alt="" width="422"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Composing a ShowBoard**

ShowBoard is a presentation in which the screen is divided into several fixed areas and filled with different content.

To create a new ShowBoard, go to the ShowBoards tab in the Content menu and click Create:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/0.jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Fill in the necessary information in the provided fields:

Name: Enter the ShowBoard name.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/1.jpeg" alt="" width="555"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Description: Add the ShowBoard description for easier content identification (optional).

Parts: To divide the screen into multiple sections, select the number of areas and their configuration for the screen layout.

Background color: Choose the background color, which will be displayed in the areas not occupied by the ShowBoard items.

After filling in the values and clicking Save, the system creates a ShowBoard with the specified settings and displays its details on the right side. The workspace is divided into the selected number and configuration of areas. To enter a specific area, click the big plus sign in the center of it.

You can add more areas by clicking on the small plus signs at the borders of the selected area. If you don’t need an area, you can delete it by clicking on the bucket icon ![A white trash can on a red background

Description automatically generated](../../.gitbook/assets/2.jpeg) in the upper right corner of the selected area.

To populate the ShowBoard with items, such as images, videos, web objects, created ScreenFlows, or created Playlists, click on the type of media object you want to insert into the selected area of the ShowBoard:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/3.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For each area, you can choose to Use Borders and adjust the width of the borders in the Content Display settings on the right side.

You can also use the CTRL + P keyboard combination to start playback. Pressing this combination once starts playback in a smaller window; the next time you click the shortcut, the display will be maximized.

To stop playback, use the CTRL + S keyboard combination. Pressing this combination once shrinks the display to a smaller size; the next time you click the shortcut, the assigned content will stop displaying.

friendlyway Player settings are called by clicking the button ![](../../.gitbook/assets/16.png) in the upper window panel:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/17.jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Device ID: A unique identifier used to identify a device in the system.

Platform URL: "/api" must be at the end of the Platform address.

Online mode: A connection to the Platform is established regularly to update content and settings from the server. If this parameter is disabled, content that was downloaded the last time you connected to the cloud is played.

Start in tray: If enabled, friendlyway Player launches minimized as an icon on the Windows taskbar.

Show player at application start: If enabled, content playback starts automatically when friendlyway Player is loaded. If this parameter is disabled, you should start playback manually using the CTRL + P keyboard shortcut or the corresponding button on the top panel of the player window.

Auto Update: Allow automatic software updates.

Auto Start: If enabled, friendlyway Player starts automatically when running an operating system.

Auto Logon: If enabled, the registered Windows user login credentials will be used at the system startup. The end user does not need to log in after restarting the computer. Here you need to enter the domain (if any), login, and password.

Please note: To change the Auto Start and Auto Logon options, you need to run friendlyway Player with administrator rights.

### Content assignment and transmission <a href="#bookmark15" id="bookmark15"></a>

Content created in the online editor is assigned to device groups for playback. A group can contain one or more devices. For example, if a new ScreenFlow or an updated Playlist should be displayed on 15 output devices, it is assigned only once to the entire group.

The following steps are required to assign content to a device:

| 1 | Create and publish content. See Chapter 4.                     |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2 | Add a device to a group. See 6.1 below.                        |
| 3 | Create and publish a content playback schedule. See 6.2 below. |

#### Creating a group of devices

In the Devices area, go to the Groups tab and click Create to add a new group:

Enter the group name and optional description, select users from the drop-down list who will manage the devices and schedules in this group, and add tags, if necessary. Confirm your entry by clicking Save. The new group is now displayed in the list of available groups.

To add a device to a group, you can specify the group when you create a device or change the assignment later with just a few clicks. To do this, click the corresponding device in the list of devices and select the required group from the drop-down list:

#### Schedule creation

Content in the group is played on schedule. Go to the Schedule section and select the group for which you want to schedule content to play. After you click on a day in the calendar, the Add Content button will become active:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/0 (2).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An area with created ScreenFlows, Playlists, and ShowBoards is displayed upon clicking on Add Content:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/1 (1).jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can switch between content types, filter content, or search by name. Once you have selected the desired presentation, click Next. In the next window, you can define a repeat pattern for playing content:

Period: The time interval during the day(s) in which the content should be played.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/2 (1).jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Repeat: Define the type of playback recurrence.

* Never — display only once
* Daily — repeat every (second, third, etc.) day
* Weekly — repeat every (second, third, etc.) week
* Monthly — repeat every (second, third, etc.) month
* Yearly — repeat every year

You can specify the From and End By dates for repeat playback, choose to run it Always, or end it after a certain number of occurrences.

Once the schedule is confirmed by clicking Save, the assigned content is displayed on the calendar:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/3 (1).jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To start playing content on the output device, you should publish the schedule. To do this, click the appropriate button:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/4 (1).jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If the content itself has not yet been published, you will be asked what exactly you want to publish:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/5 (1).jpeg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After confirming your choice, you will receive a message that the schedule has been successfully published.

Playback starts on the target device.
